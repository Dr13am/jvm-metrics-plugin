= HiveMQ JVM Metrics Plugin

The HiveMQ JVM Metric Plugin adds several additional metrics about the Java Virtual Machine to HiveMQ's internal metric registry. This allows for a deeper insight on what is happening inside the Java Virtual Machine and provides interesting information on memory usage and other runtime metrics provided by the JVM running HiveMQ.

These metrics include information about:

* Memory usage
* Threads
* Class Loaders
* Garbage Collection
* Open Files
* Buffer Pool

These metrics can be accessed by using the https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-jmx-plugin[JMX-Plugin] or the https://github.com/hivemq/graphite-plugin[Graphite Plugin].

Or you can use these metrics in https://www.hivemq.com/docs/3.4/plugins/services.html#metric-service[your own HiveMQ plugin]

== Installation

. Download the sources of a plugin and build it 
. Unzip the contents of your download
. Copy the jar file to the plugins folder inside your HiveMQ folder.

Read more about installing and configuring plugins in the https://www.hivemq.com/docs/3.4/plugins/introduction.html[HiveMQ Plugin Documentation].
